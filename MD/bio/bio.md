# About me
Although majored in Computer Science I consider myself a Full-stack Web Developer. 
I love being able to create websites for companies/clients because it is all like magic to me, a magic that helps people prosper in life and showcase whatever they want!
I don't let it consume my life entirely...only about 80% :D , the rest goes to Hiking or just being surrounded by nature in general, spending time with my family, watching horror movies, watching sports(mostly soccer(football) and baseball), reading non-fiction books, caring for my aquarium fishes, roadtripping, and exercising!
