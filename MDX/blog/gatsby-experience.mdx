# The great gatsby!

This website itself was built by me using gatsby technology and I fell in love with it! 
Hugo was the first static site generator I learned and used when working with past clients and I enojoyed it very much, learning a whole different world of web development and I thank Hugo and my curiousity for
leading me to what I know choose to work with...The Great Gatsby progressive static site generator!
