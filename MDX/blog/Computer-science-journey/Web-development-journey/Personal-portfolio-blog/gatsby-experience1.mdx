# The great gatsby!

This website itself was built by me using gatsby technology and I fell in love with it! 
Hugo was the first static site generator I learned and used when working with past clients and I enojoyed it very much, learning a whole different world of web development and I thank Hugo and my curiousity for
leading me to what I know choose to work with...The Great Gatsby progressive static site generator! 

#### personal advice of my own coding wisdom:
have basic layout and template pages then focus on all data gathering, data injection, data manipulations and needed functions and hooked components before moving onto the visual art designer aspect of your website.
grab the pieces of data abstracted and stylalized as desired. 
oRganized matters
