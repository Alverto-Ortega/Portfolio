### Lesson Overview:
Local indexed search functionalities are great optimal choice for smaller sites that don't contain lots of 
pages. 

### Stop Words:
stop words is a feature that prevents certain letters/words from showing up as results
for a searched query in your document.
For example if searching "astronmy" and you have a stop word list contaning "as" then the word "as"
will be exluded in the result.

elasticlunr by default already has some defined stop words but to cuztomize your own stop words
you can do so like so :
```js
var my_stop_words = ['as', 'hi', 'yes'];
elasticlunr.addStopWords(my_stop_words);
```

### Language support:
elasticlunr supports other languages for searching documents such as spanish:
Including the required scrips:
```html
<script src="lunr.stemmer.support.js"></script
<script src="lunr.es.js"></script>
```
and within the index variable instance of the elasticlunr function include:
```
this.use(elasticlunr.es);
```
The "es" for spanish language support.

Benefits include: offline search features, adding cuztomized stop words, other language search,
query-time boosting, effective scoring mechanism, field-search, boolean model, quick search, and small index size.
