## React components
All named starting with a capitalized letter so that react can recognize them when used as a component apart
from the HTMl, `<ComponentName />`

# re-rendering a react DOM
when re-rendering a react DOM whitin a component, the only actualy element re-rendered is the changed element within that component, thanks to the virtual React DOM Algorithm.  
Still this re-rendering is not the most efficient and so we welcome the react state, allowing us to manage changing data in our application...

## **Stateful Component** (React class-based Components)
A class with Internal State.  
Much more complex than a stateless component.  
The state is always an object instead of a function.
These contain data with a state that changes overtime and is reflected in the User Interface Immediately via the virtual React DOM.   
These components are defined as a class.  
Able to output dynamic interface elements.

# `setState` function is Asynchronous; Asynchronous as in executing other statements while the previous statement is processing until complete.

## How to use setState function
If you don't need to know to keep track of values and don't need `prevState` parameter to find the next state value
then pass an object as the first argmument in `setState`.
Otherwise, if you need the `prevState` parameter to track and find the next state value use a function
as the first argument to `setState` function. 
Note: state methods only apply to class-based components

## React lifecycle method
The `componentDidUpdate` method is used to do something when state or properties are updated to avoid
conflict or confusion with the `setState` Asynchronous function.
Note: this lifecycle method only applies to class components

## **Stateless Functional Components**
A function that accepts props and returns JSX.  
This is a much more simpler component which works with the react's `props`system with basic output functionality.  
The Interface is unable to changes based on user input or other changing data.
This is the best type of components to use throughout your app to help
contain the state management to a specific area of the app, improving
development and maintenance process.

This component is slightly faster than class-based components since they dont have a lifecycle method and added data from the extended `React.Component` class.

The `this` keyword is not used in functional components for binding data as opposed to 
class-based components which needs to use `this` for binding data.  
Instead `props` is used as a parameter followed by object destructuring to get it's values.  


## React hooks  
As previously mentioned, functional components do not use state or contain lifecycle methods, however,  
React introduced hooks which is basically a functional component that uses state and lifecycle methods.  
This is the preferred component to use because it makes way for simpler and readable code with features  
of both class-based and functional components.

Declare states by using `useState` hook which accepts a parameter as the initial value of the state.  
The initial value can be of any type(number, string, object,etc...)  
The `useState` hook returns an array, a value of the current state and the function to update the state, respectively.  
Example(using destructing syntax):  
```
  const [name, setName] =  useState("Miguel");
```
the function name `setName` should always start with `set` as the prefix for updating state, althought not mandatory.
