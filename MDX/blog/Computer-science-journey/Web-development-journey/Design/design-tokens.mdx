# Design Tokens: 

This concept of design tokens is a way in which you store variables with objects containing key:value pairs of a specfic 
styling value you have used throughtout your project and be able to reliably access this data in other similar projects.
values of CSS Attributes...
Injecting data via json, etc...

-The advantages include being able to have a single-source-of-truth file in which you can apply to other projects.
    - Easier and simpler to implement a new and/or other projects styling. Set as a dafault standard for all projects using it
    - can caterogize styling according to their needs such as subjects of e-commerse, blog, etc... styling.
    - Maintain scalable and consistent design system for your user interfaces.
    - Can be used across many, if not all, platforms for gathering and injecting data.
    - Saves duplicate code

-Examples of where it can be applied:
    - store design tokens that inlcude values of brand color or any value that will be reused
        as my design system across multiple apps and/or dev teams.

# Examples of variables created for a button componenet that you would like to apply 
in other apps or parts of your project.
# File: button.json
    {
            "default-button" : "bg-blue w-50 h-25 text-small hover:bg-sky-700"
    }
# above uses tailwindcss styling variables
# can be used with other stylign libraries such as SCSS

# then in your page on root directory use the token variable:
# File: template.html
    <!doctype html>
    <html >
        <head>....</head>
        <body>
            <h1> Here is the button : </h1>
            <button class="{{ default-button }}> This is the button! </button>
        </body>
    </html>

This can be used for many purposes including but not limited to: 

    * Small design teams that seek consistent systems(in this case design system) for implementing 
        into each dev team's project you're working with.
    * Using your personal styling convention as default for UI's across your multiple projects, etc..
